# Cifar10-classification-using-CNN

The code consists of a CNN coded using keras. The dataset is the Cifar10 dataset readily available on the internet.

The aim of the project is to practically learn and implement about CNN. This project will have two main sections.

..*Section 1: Build a convolutional layer and pooling layer from scratch. Then test them on a sample image.

..*Section 2: Use the Keras library to implement a CNN to classify images on the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
